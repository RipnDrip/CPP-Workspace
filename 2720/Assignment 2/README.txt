Use the command "make" to compile and run project.

//Complexity Questions

Merge Function:

The merge function takes in a sorted linked list and as long as it is not empty, it inserts that list into the original list that the function was called on.
Complexity: O(n)
This is not the best efficiency as the usual efficiency of the merge function might require two loops, so maybe O(n^2).

Find Common Elements Function (intersection):

This function is similar to merge, in the sense that it takes in a sorted linked list and using a while loop, iterates through to get the value of each item for each lsit (the parameter\
 and the list the function is called on). Then it prints original list with only the intersecting values.
Complexity: O(n)
This is the best efficiency of this function because it needs the one while loop to iterate through and find the intersecting values.
